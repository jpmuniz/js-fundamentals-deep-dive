JavaScript is a language that can be executed both in the browser and on the server.

To do this, it depends on a runtime, such as browsers or Node.js, which provides the necessary APIs for interaction with the environment.

In the browser, JavaScript interacts with HTML through the DOM (Document Object Model).

Through the `<script>` tag, JavaScript code has access to the `document` object, allowing it to manipulate elements, react to events, and control the application's behavior according to requirements.

JavaScript was designed as a single-threaded language, meaning it executes one frame/function at a time.

To handle asynchronous operations without blocking execution, the runtime uses the Event Loop, which coordinates the order of task execution.
