The Call Stack is the data structure used by the JavaScript engine to control the execution of synchronous functions.

## How it works
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure
- Only one function is executed at a time
- One function must finish before the next one can start

## Implications
- Thread blocking during long execution
- Stack overflow in deep recursive calls
